# Javascript Object Notation (`JSON`)

JSON is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data.It is 
often used when data is sent from a server to a web page. 

* Data representation format that is very similar to `XML` or `yamo`
* Commonly used for creating/consuming API & file configs
* Lightweight: Easy to `Read` & `Write` compared to XML

* It also intergrates easily with most languages
